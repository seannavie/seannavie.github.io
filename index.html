    Hello! Welcome to my personal site where I hope you can learn more about values, objectives, and experiences as an educator and scholar. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Virginia in the Department of English. My research focuses on Afro- and Indo-Caribbean speculative fiction, with attention to recovery, gender, space, as well as the Digital and Environmental Humanities. Working within mid-20th and 21st-century Anglophone novels, my work privileges worldmaking as an alternative archive of memory. 
</p>
<p>
    At UVA, not only am I committed to further exposing others to the richness of Black speculative fiction but I am also committed to multicultural, culturally relevant, as well as antiracist pedagogy. I look forward to the ways in which I can continue to work towards diversity and inclusion both in and outside of the classroom, as I hope my site will reflect.
